# iVenus Scratchpad
Execute python code directly from inside Apple Notes!

### Install
This shortcuts requires the app a-Shell to run, it's free on the app store!
Just import the installation shortcut below and run it! It will clone the repo and import another shortcut called `Run iVenus Scratchpad`. \
If you have iOS 18 I recommend adding that shortcut to your control center.

**NOTE: If you don't get a prompt to import `Run iVenus Scratchpad` just run the install shortcut again**

### Usage
Tag any note with the `#python` tag then write blocks of code enclosed with triple backticks `` ``` ``\
The backticks should be on their own line at the start and and of any code blocks\
All code blocks in a note are run together, so you can set a variable in one block and print it in the next block\
When you're ready to run the code just run the `Run iVenus Scratchpad` shortcut!\
The shortcut will always run on the MOST RECENTLY EDITED NOTE containing the `#python` tag\
It will append the result to the note\
After you're done checking the output you can undo `âŒ˜+z` to remove the output to keep the note clean
## Please report bugs!
I made this all at 3AM so I've definitely missed something.\
I'm especially concerned about sanitizing the inputs, because I don't know what I'm doing.\
So if you find any bugs please report them on the issues page!\
